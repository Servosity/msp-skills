## [0.1.3] - unreleased

### Fixed
- **`sync` costs milliseconds of CPU per row, not about a second.** The credential check on rows written to the local store read every row through each decoder it knows, which pinned a CPU for hours on a large first sync. It now refuses a row only when the row carries a secret a vendor response returned (raw or JSON-escaped) and stores every other row unread: a 1,177-record first sync went from 354 CPU-s to under 1. The local store is no longer searched for this program's own credentials; what the CLI prints, writes to other files or sends is checked exactly as before (#612).
- **A withheld row no longer fails `sync`.** `sync` names the withheld row IDs on stderr and in its summary (`"withheld"`), still exits 0 when every other row stored, and keeps that resource's checkpoint, so the next run fetches the row again (#612).
- **`sync` progress shows a real request rate.** On an API that sends no rate-limit headers, `rate_rps` in sync progress climbed without bound (6.6e24 was seen), because the request pacer kept raising a rate no request reached; after that a rate-limit answer could no longer slow requests down. The pacer now raises its rate only while it is holding requests back.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-11-09

### Changed
- **Lower startup cost.** The credential check over the program's own fixed text and the local store's fixed SQL statements reads its verdict from a table built for this connector, instead of decoding that text again in every process (about 0.5 CPU-s at startup and 0.4 CPU-s on each store open). A credential in that text is withheld exactly as before (#662).

### Fixed
- **`sync` memory no longer climbs.** The credential check on every row a sync stores no longer grows with each page or spikes on one large record: between records memory falls back to where it started, so a first sync of a large account finishes in a 1 GB container. The check is exactly as strict as before (#612).
- **One withheld row no longer stops a sync.** A row the credential check keeps out of the local store is skipped instead of failing its whole batch: every other row is stored, `sync` names the withheld row IDs and exits non-zero, and that resource's checkpoint stays put, so the next run fetches the row again (#612).
- **`sync --concurrency` above 1 no longer interleaves writes.** Its parallel workers shared one event writer that nothing serialized, so `--deliver`, `--receipt-file` and `--audit-dir` could crash or record a receipt hash that did not match the output. Writes are now serialized (#676).

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed
- Output that holds no credential is no longer replaced by "withheld ... it carried a credential". Long or rich text, such as HTML email with Outlook Safe Links or long incident reports, ran out the shared credential kit's checking budget and was withheld as if it carried a credential. A credential the program holds is still withheld ([#571](https://github.com/Servosity/msp-skills/pull/571)).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added
- Initial msp-skills release: the Apple Business CLI (`apple-business-cli`) and MCP
  server (`apple-business-mcp`), printed on CLI Printing Press 4.34.2.
- Every Apple Business API read and write: devices, MDM servers, device activities,
  AppleCare coverage, Activation Lock, users, user groups, org units, apps, packages,
  Blueprints, Configurations and audit events.
- Fleet reports from a local store per customer org: `devices unassigned`,
  `devices locked`, `applecare expiring`, `fleet summary` (one row per org),
  `mdm-servers health`, plus `devices lookup` by serial, MAC, IMEI, EID or order number.
- `devices assign` and `devices unassign` move serials between MDM servers by name,
  with `--dry-run`, `--wait` and a per-serial verification.
- `audit-events digest` and `audit-events actors` turn a relative window into readable
  change logs and per-actor counts.
- ES256 client-assertion authentication; one API account per customer organization.
- Credentials are held from startup and withheld, in any encoding, from every output,
  file, store write and MCP result; they are sent only to Apple's hosts.
- Over MCP, every write tool previews and runs only with `confirm: true`.
