[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.14] - unreleased

### Fixed
- **The `auvik_search` MCP tool's description now names this API's resources.** It used to be one sentence shared by every connector, so an MCP host that picks tools by matching words ranked other tools above it for a request like `<vendor> <resource>`. The description now ends with the resource families from the endpoint list, most endpoints first, at most 300 characters ([#629](https://github.com/Servosity/msp-skills/issues/629)).

## [0.2.13] - 2026-11-11

### Fixed
- **`store_status` no longer stays `partial` for good when your token cannot read a resource.** A resource the vendor refuses this token (HTTP 403) is now recorded as skipped. `search` and `sql` report `complete_with_skips` when everything else finished and name what was skipped under `skipped_forbidden`. A resource that failed still leaves the store `partial` and is named under `incomplete_resources`, and the `sync` summary names both. The `sync` exit code is unchanged ([#692](https://github.com/Servosity/msp-skills/issues/692)).
- **`sync` progress reports the rate it measured.** `rate_rps` in the `sync_progress` event used to be the request pacer's ceiling. It now carries the measured rows per second over the last 30 seconds, the same value as the new `rows_per_sec`. The ceiling, when one is active, is the new `limiter_ceiling_rps`, and the progress line reads like `[33.0 rows/s, limit 4.9 req/s]` ([#694](https://github.com/Servosity/msp-skills/issues/694)).
- **`sync` spends far less CPU on progress output.** Every line the CLI prints goes through the credential check, and that check costs about the same whether the line is long or short. `sync` printed one progress line per page. It now prints the first page's line and then at most one every 5 seconds per resource; each line still carries the measured rate, and the final count still arrives in `sync_complete` and the done line ([#696](https://github.com/Servosity/msp-skills/issues/696)).

## [0.2.12] - 2026-11-11

### Security
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.11, which fixes a crash in Go's HTTP/1 server (GO-2026-6859).** A race in `net/http`'s `MaxBytesReader` could crash a Go HTTP server on a crafted request. No dependency changed.

## [0.2.11] - 2026-11-10

### Fixed
- **`sync` costs milliseconds of CPU per row, not about a second.** The credential check on rows written to the local store read every row through each decoder it knows, which pinned a CPU for hours on a large first sync. It now refuses a row only when the row carries a secret a vendor response returned (raw or JSON-escaped) and stores every other row unread: a 1,177-record first sync went from 354 CPU-s to under 1. The local store is no longer searched for this program's own credentials; what the CLI prints, writes to other files or sends is checked exactly as before (#612).
- **`sync` progress shows a real request rate.** On an API that sends no rate-limit headers, `rate_rps` in sync progress climbed without bound (6.6e24 was seen), because the request pacer kept raising a rate no request reached; after that a rate-limit answer could no longer slow requests down. The pacer now raises its rate only while it is holding requests back.

## [0.2.10] - 2026-11-09

### Fixed
- **`sync` memory no longer climbs.** The credential check on every row a sync stores no longer grows with each page or spikes on one large record: between records memory falls back to where it started, so a first sync of a large account finishes in a 1 GB container. The check is exactly as strict as before (#612).

## [0.2.9] - 2026-11-07

### Security
- Rebuilt on CLI Printing Press 4.35.1 ([GHSA-jh26-vhqh-692c](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jh26-vhqh-692c)). The MCP server's HTTP mode refuses to start until `AUVIK_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` is set (32 characters or more), listens on `127.0.0.1:7777` by default, and needs `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key` on any other address. The code-orchestration execute tool previews every state-changing call until `confirm` is `true`. `AUVIK_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`, `AUVIK_MCP_READ_ONLY` and `AUVIK_NO_LOCAL_DATA` are now declared on every install channel.

### Added
- `tenants scorecard`: one row per client with end-of-support exposure, configuration backup gaps, discovery blind spots and alert volume, worst first. Every column is computed by the same code as its single-purpose command.

### Changed
- Sync partitions follow the 4.35.1 names: `inventory-device-info` holds devices (`inventory` now holds components), `asm-app-info` holds ASM applications (`asm` now holds ASM clients), and `auvik-inventory` holds v2 discovery status. Rows an older version synced move to the new partition the next time the store is opened for writing (any `sync`), so a full sync keeps or retires them like any other row. Each command's `--help` prints the exact `sync --resources ...` line it needs.

### Fixed
- `eol`: a device whose lifecycle status is `unpublished` or `empty`, or that only reports sales availability, is bucketed `unknown`, not `supported`.
- `device discovery-gaps` reads the discovery probes on a device's detail record, so a device whose SNMP credentials are rejected is a gap even with no v2 status row.
- `asm shadow` counts a licence only against the application it was read for, and lists a licence read that failed (or returned no `data`) under `license_lookup_failed` instead of reporting no licences.
- `usage reconcile` reads the documented daily server and workstation count arrays instead of reporting zero.
- `inventory diff --snapshot` records an empty fleet as the newest baseline, so removals are not reported again on every run.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-10-23

### Changed
- `cli/NOTICE` now names the product `auvik-cli`, the binary this connector installs, instead of the generator's internal `-pp-cli` name. No code change.

### Security
- **An error can no longer show a credential the server repeated back in an encoded form.** The CLI and the MCP server masked a key, token or password only as written or URL-escaped. When an API error echoed it HTML-entity-encoded, JSON-escaped, double URL-encoded, base64 or hex, it reached the terminal, `--json` and `--agent` output, and MCP tool results. Now any such text that still carries a credential this program holds, in any of those forms, is replaced whole by `[text withheld: it repeated a secret value this program holds]`; the HTTP status, the hint and the exit code are kept. The same check also runs on every error a command prints, including `--json` and `--agent` error output, and on every MCP error result; successful output is unchanged.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-10-22

### Security
- The MCP server drops the flags whose values name a file or directory on the machine that runs it (for example --db, --output) from its tool schemas and refuses them by name, instead of advertising them and ignoring them silently. The command line keeps every flag.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-10-21

### Security
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.10, which distrusts compromised intermediate certificates in `crypto/x509` (GO-2026-6809).** Go now rejects those certificates itself when it verifies the vendor's HTTPS certificate, so the connector no longer depends on the system trust store having been updated to reject them. No other dependency changed.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-10-15

### Fixed
- **Windows: the built-in Administrator account can save credentials.** On the built-in
  local Administrator (common on MSP servers and jump boxes), saving credentials failed
  with `token file DACL grants access to a non-owner principal (LA)`, and reads refused
  the saved file. The token-file permission check compared security-descriptor text
  instead of account SIDs; it now resolves each trustee to a SID first. The allowed
  principals are unchanged: your account, BUILTIN\Administrators and SYSTEM.
- **Windows: a token file with a NULL DACL is now refused.** A NULL DACL (no access
  control at all, so any account on the machine can read the file) written with its
  flags first, which is how Windows Server 2025 renders it, passed the check. The check
  now parses the DACL exactly and refuses anything it cannot parse.

### Changed
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.9 (was 1.26.6).** Go 1.26.9 includes upstream Go security
  fixes, among them the `net/http` advisories GO-2026-6617, GO-2026-6613 and
  GO-2026-6612.
- **The Claude Desktop bundle now carries the companion CLI.** Every MCP tool runs the
  CLI under the hood, but this connector's previous `.mcpb` contained only the MCP
  server, so a one-click install on a machine without the CLI failed at the first tool
  call. This release's bundle ships both binaries side by side for macOS (universal),
  Windows x64 and Linux x64.
- **The MCP server reports its real version.** `serverInfo.version` read `0.0.0-dev` in
  the previous release because the release build stamped the version into the CLI
  only. The release now stamps both and checks the built server's `initialize` reply
  against the tag before publishing.
- **Installers verify what they download.** `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now require a
  sealed (immutable) release, verify both binaries against the release's SHA-256
  sidecars before touching anything, and replace the old binaries in a single
  transaction that is undone if any step fails. (Served from the repository, so this
  already applies to every install, not only this version.)

## [0.2.4] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **A tool-call value could smuggle a refused flag past the MCP server.** The MCP server
  handed each tool argument to the CLI as two separate words, the flag and then its value.
  On a yes/no flag the CLI does not read the next word as a value, so a value that itself
  began with `--` was read as a brand-new flag, including flags the server deliberately
  refuses such as `--deliver`, which can send command output to a URL. Every argument that
  carries a value now travels glued to its flag as one word (`--flag=value`), so the CLI only
  ever reads it as the value of that one named flag, or rejects it, and it can never become a
  second flag. A plain yes/no flag is still a bare `--flag`, and an empty value is still left out.
  Reported privately through SECURITY.md; the same fix is in the pending DataGate connector.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **`recall` and `playbook list` no longer claim to be read-only.** Both open the writable
  learn store and record a row, but were annotated `mcp:read-only=true` - and that annotation
  is what an MCP host reads to decide what to auto-approve without asking you. They are now
  `mcp:local-write`, a tier this engine already defines and already uses for `teach`: writes
  land only in the CLI's own local store, never in external state and never in a user-visible
  file. Measured at the live MCP server, both tools moved from `readOnlyHint=true,
  openWorldHint=true` to `readOnlyHint=false, destructiveHint=false, openWorldHint=false`.
  No behaviour changed - both commands write exactly what they wrote before. The promise was
  the defect, not the write.

### Changed
- Install and remote-agent documentation corrected against the shipped binaries. The remote
  section named `mcp-remote`, which bridges the opposite direction and cannot publish a local
  stdio server at all; connectors that parse `--transport http` now point at the native flag
  and the rest at `supergateway`. The HTTP endpoint is `/mcp`, not the bare root the docs gave.
  The Windows install path and a fallback paragraph describing an `npx` install that is not
  offered were both wrong and are gone. A new `check_install_docs` gate holds these claims
  against the binaries and installers so they cannot drift again.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **An agent could point this connector's local database at any file on the machine.**
  The MCP server forwarded a `db` argument straight through to `sync`, and the store runs a
  migration that drops and rebuilds its tables. A tool call naming another application's SQLite
  file would therefore rewrite that file. The MCP surface now refuses arguments that name a
  filesystem location - by name, and by what the flag's own help text says it does, so a newly
  generated path flag is refused before anyone has to notice it. Nothing an agent could
  legitimately call changed.

### Changed
- Every source file now carries one project copyright line (`Copyright 2026 Servosity Inc. and msp-skills contributors`) instead of the ten different strings the fleet had accumulated; individual contributor credit moved to the repository `NOTICE`. Source headers only, no behaviour changed.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **`doctor` reported health it had not established.** It treated any HTTP response to `GET /` as
  a healthy API, so a base URL aimed at the vendor's web UI - where every API path 404s - rendered
  exactly like a working install.
  The credential was never checked at all: the report said `present, not verified` and left you to
  guess. `doctor` now issues one authenticated GET against a real read endpoint and reports what came
  back, so an expired token reads as rejected and a wrong base URL reads as a wrong base URL.
  `--fail-on` no longer scans hints and file paths for the word "error", which is what made it trip on
  healthy connectors.

- **The install prompted for the wrong credentials.** The binary reads environment variables that the
  Claude Desktop bundle never declared, so you were asked for the wrong set and the connector could not
  authenticate. Now declared on every install channel: `AUVIK_TENANT`, `AUVIK_USER_AGENT`, `PRINTING_PRESS_CLIENT_PROFILE`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-17

### Security

- Go toolchain bumped to **go1.26.6**, which fixes **GO-2026-6218** (quadratic
  complexity in `net/url`, reachable from `cliutil.ProbeReachable`). The
  previously released binary was built with go1.26.5 and carried the advisory.
  CI could not catch this: the workflows request `go-version: "1.26"`, which
  resolves to the latest patched Go, so the security gate scanned a patched
  toolchain while the build honoured the pinned one. See issue #210.

### Fixed

- **MCP tools are no longer default-denied.** Every tool that is not a Cobra
  mirror - `search`, `sql`, `context`, and the `auvik_search` / `auvik_get` /
  `auvik_execute` code-orchestration trio - returned
  `MCP tenant gate is not configured` instead of running. The generated tenant
  gate treated "no platform source registered" as a failure rather than as
  "nothing to gate", and no connector registers one. The previously released
  binary had 6 dead tools. See issue #249.

- **Windows binaries now exist.** `internal/cli/auvik_snapshot_lock.go` called
  `syscall.Flock`, which does not exist on Windows, with no build tag - so the
  Windows targets had never compiled and were silently absent from the release
  assets, even though `manifest.json` declared `win32` support. Split on
  `//go:build`, with `LockFileEx` on Windows.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- fix(mcp): stop the tenant gate default-denying every non-mirror tool (#249) (#250)
- skill(auvik): Auvik network-monitoring connector (CLI + MCP) (#238)

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial msp-skills release: `auvik-cli` and `auvik-mcp` for the Auvik
  JSON:API (read-dominant - dismissing an alert is the only write it exposes), plus a local SQLite mirror.
- Full endpoint surface: inventory, devices, interfaces, networks, alerts,
  configurations, entity audit and notes, billing usage, statistics, and the
  Auvik SaaS Management (ASM) applications, users, and licences.
- Eight cross-client analyses the API cannot answer in one call: `eol`,
  `changes`, `configuration audit`, `inventory diff`, `usage reconcile`,
  `device discovery-gaps`, `alert noise`, and `asm shadow`.
- `inventory diff --snapshot` keeps a prior view of the fleet, which is the only
  way a device REMOVAL is detectable - the Auvik API emits no deletion event.
