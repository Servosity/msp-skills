## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **An agent could point this connector's local database at any file on the machine.**
  The MCP server forwarded a `db` argument straight through to `sync`, and the store runs a
  migration that drops and rebuilds its tables. A tool call naming another application's SQLite
  file would therefore rewrite that file. The MCP surface now refuses arguments that name a
  filesystem location - by name, and by what the flag's own help text says it does, so a newly
  generated path flag is refused before anyone has to notice it. Nothing an agent could
  legitimately call changed.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **`doctor` reported health it had not established.** It treated any HTTP response to `GET /` as
  a healthy API, so a base URL aimed at the vendor's web UI - where every API path 404s - rendered
  exactly like a working install.
  The credential was never checked at all: the report said `present, not verified` and left you to
  guess. `doctor` now issues one authenticated GET against a real read endpoint and reports what came
  back, so an expired token reads as rejected and a wrong base URL reads as a wrong base URL.
  `--fail-on` no longer scans hints and file paths for the word "error", which is what made it trip on
  healthy connectors.

- **The install prompted for the wrong credentials.** The binary reads environment variables that the
  Claude Desktop bundle never declared, so you were asked for the wrong set and the connector could not
  authenticate. Now declared on every install channel: `AUVIK_TENANT`, `AUVIK_USER_AGENT`, `PRINTING_PRESS_CLIENT_PROFILE`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-17

### Security

- Go toolchain bumped to **go1.26.6**, which fixes **GO-2026-6218** (quadratic
  complexity in `net/url`, reachable from `cliutil.ProbeReachable`). The
  previously released binary was built with go1.26.5 and carried the advisory.
  CI could not catch this: the workflows request `go-version: "1.26"`, which
  resolves to the latest patched Go, so the security gate scanned a patched
  toolchain while the build honoured the pinned one. See issue #210.

### Fixed

- **MCP tools are no longer default-denied.** Every tool that is not a Cobra
  mirror - `search`, `sql`, `context`, and the `auvik_search` / `auvik_get` /
  `auvik_execute` code-orchestration trio - returned
  `MCP tenant gate is not configured` instead of running. The generated tenant
  gate treated "no platform source registered" as a failure rather than as
  "nothing to gate", and no connector registers one. The previously released
  binary had 6 dead tools. See issue #249.

- **Windows binaries now exist.** `internal/cli/auvik_snapshot_lock.go` called
  `syscall.Flock`, which does not exist on Windows, with no build tag - so the
  Windows targets had never compiled and were silently absent from the release
  assets, even though `manifest.json` declared `win32` support. Split on
  `//go:build`, with `LockFileEx` on Windows.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-17

### Changed

- fix(mcp): stop the tenant gate default-denying every non-mirror tool (#249) (#250)
- skill(auvik): Auvik network-monitoring connector (CLI + MCP) (#238)

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial msp-skills release: `auvik-cli` and `auvik-mcp` for the Auvik
  JSON:API (read-dominant - dismissing an alert is the only write it exposes), plus a local SQLite mirror.
- Full endpoint surface: inventory, devices, interfaces, networks, alerts,
  configurations, entity audit and notes, billing usage, statistics, and the
  Auvik SaaS Management (ASM) applications, users, and licences.
- Eight cross-client analyses the API cannot answer in one call: `eol`,
  `changes`, `configuration audit`, `inventory diff`, `usage reconcile`,
  `device discovery-gaps`, `alert noise`, and `asm shadow`.
- `inventory diff --snapshot` keeps a prior view of the fleet, which is the only
  way a device REMOVAL is detectable - the Auvik API emits no deletion event.
