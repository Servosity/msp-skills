## [0.1.8] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **An agent could point this connector's local database at any file on the machine.**
  The MCP server forwarded a `db` argument straight through to `sync`, and the store runs a
  migration that drops and rebuilds its tables. A tool call naming another application's SQLite
  file would therefore rewrite that file. The MCP surface now refuses arguments that name a
  filesystem location - by name, and by what the flag's own help text says it does, so a newly
  generated path flag is refused before anyone has to notice it. Nothing an agent could
  legitimately call changed.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **`doctor` reported health it had not established.** It treated any HTTP response to `GET /` as
  a healthy API, so a base URL aimed at the vendor's web UI - where every API path 404s - rendered
  exactly like a working install.
  The credential was never checked at all: the report said `present, not verified` and left you to
  guess. `doctor` now issues one authenticated GET against a real read endpoint and reports what came
  back, so an expired token reads as rejected and a wrong base URL reads as a wrong base URL.
  It also dialled the shipped placeholder base URL (`https://your-domain.huducloud.com/api/v1`) and rendered the resulting failure
  as `FAIL API: unreachable`, telling an operator who had supplied every credential the install asked
  for that they were broken. It now refuses to dial a placeholder and names `HUDU_BASE_URL`,
  the variable that actually fixes it.
  `--fail-on` no longer scans hints and file paths for the word "error", which is what made it trip on
  healthy connectors.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-17

### Security

- Go toolchain bumped to **go1.26.6**, which fixes **GO-2026-6218** (quadratic
  complexity in `net/url`, reachable from `cliutil.ProbeReachable`). The
  previously released binary was built with go1.26.5 and carried the advisory.
  CI could not catch this: the workflows request `go-version: "1.26"`, which
  resolves to the latest patched Go, so the security gate scanned a patched
  toolchain while the build honoured the pinned one. See issue #210.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- fix(hudu): reconcile procedure task sync totals (#194)
- chore(fleet): bump Go toolchain to go1.26.5 across 54 connectors (GO-2026-5856) (#189)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-07-07

### Changed

- fix(hudu): relations page_size=25 + sync --exclude (#167, #168, #169) (#181)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- fix(hudu): IPAM endpoints are non-paginated, enable the page walk, skip matchers (#158, #159) (#161)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-22

### Changed

- fix(hudu): stop sending page_size to IPAM endpoints that reject it (#153) (#156)
- fleet: re-vendor 48 connectors to printing-press 4.24.0 engine (#96)
- chore(fleet): press-version provenance + back-fill hand-fix ledgers (#91)
- fix: drop false "with sound" demo claim, highlight first-party Servosity, point backup/DR skills at Servosity (#77)

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial msp-skills release: `hudu-cli` + `hudu-mcp` (123 MCP tools) for the Hudu
  IT-documentation API.
- Offline SQLite mirror (`sync`) with FTS5 full-text `search` over every synced
  resource, plus `--data-source auto|live|local`.
- Documentation-hygiene audits over the mirror: `audit completeness`,
  `audit stale-passwords`, `audit expirations`, `audit stale-articles`,
  `audit layout-drift`, and a worst-first cross-tenant `audit summary`.
- `onboard` to scaffold a new client's asset layouts, folders, and procedures from
  a saved house template (preview by default, `--apply` to write).
- `resolve` a Hudu URL or exact name to its asset/company/layout/relations, and
  `reconcile` PSA/RMM integrator records against live Hudu assets.
- Agent-native output (`--agent`, `--json`, `--compact`, `--select`) for use from
  Claude Code, Codex, and any MCP-capable agent.
