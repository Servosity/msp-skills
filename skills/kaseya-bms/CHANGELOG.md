## [0.1.12] - 2026-11-11

### Security
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.11, which fixes a crash in Go's HTTP/1 server (GO-2026-6859).** A race in `net/http`'s `MaxBytesReader` could crash a Go HTTP server on a crafted request. No dependency changed.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-11-10

### Fixed
- **`sync` costs milliseconds of CPU per row, not about a second.** The credential check on rows written to the local store read every row through each decoder it knows, which pinned a CPU for hours on a large first sync. It now refuses a row only when the row carries a secret a vendor response returned (raw or JSON-escaped) and stores every other row unread: a 1,177-record first sync went from 354 CPU-s to under 1. The local store is no longer searched for this program's own credentials; what the CLI prints, writes to other files or sends is checked exactly as before (#612).
- **A withheld row no longer fails `sync`.** `sync` names the withheld row IDs on stderr and in its summary (`"withheld"`), still exits 0 when every other row stored, and keeps that resource's checkpoint, so the next run fetches the row again (#612).
- **`sync` progress shows a real request rate.** On an API that sends no rate-limit headers, `rate_rps` in sync progress climbed without bound (6.6e24 was seen), because the request pacer kept raising a rate no request reached; after that a rate-limit answer could no longer slow requests down. The pacer now raises its rate only while it is holding requests back.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-11-09

### Changed
- **Lower startup cost.** The credential check over the program's own fixed text and the local store's fixed SQL statements reads its verdict from a table built for this connector, instead of decoding that text again in every process (about 0.5 CPU-s at startup and 0.4 CPU-s on each store open). A credential in that text is withheld exactly as before (#662).

### Fixed
- **`sync` memory no longer climbs.** The credential check on every row a sync stores no longer grows with each page or spikes on one large record: between records memory falls back to where it started, so a first sync of a large account finishes in a 1 GB container. The check is exactly as strict as before (#612).
- **One withheld row no longer stops a sync.** A row the credential check keeps out of the local store is skipped instead of failing its whole batch: every other row is stored, `sync` names the withheld row IDs and exits non-zero, and that resource's checkpoint stays put, so the next run fetches the row again (#612).
- **`sync --concurrency` above 1 no longer interleaves writes.** Its parallel workers shared one event writer that nothing serialized, so `--deliver`, `--receipt-file` and `--audit-dir` could crash or record a receipt hash that did not match the output. Writes are now serialized (#676).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-11-05

### Fixed
- The kaseya-bms-v0.1.8 tag never became a release: the release security gate stopped it on GO-2026-6911, an advisory against an mcp-go package (`client/transport`) this connector does not link. The gate now checks the packages an advisory names (#602). 0.1.9 carries every change listed under 0.1.8; 0.1.8 has no release.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-11-05

### Changed
- Rebuilt on cli-printing-press 4.34.2 (see GHSA-jh26-vhqh-692c for why the press was upgraded). The MCP server's HTTP mode now requires a bearer token (`KASEYA_BMS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`), listens on loopback by default and refuses browser origins it was not told to allow.
- Every CLI command, novel command and MCP tool now signs in with the BMS login (username, password, tenant) on first use and again when the token expires. Earlier versions minted a token only in `auth login`, so an MCP install configured with the login stopped working once the short-lived token expired. `KASEYA_BMS_TOKEN` still wins over the login when set.
- The connector now uses the shared msp-skills credential kit: every credential it holds is kept out of terminal output, files, the local store, logs and MCP results, and is sent only to the configured Kaseya BMS API over https, never across a redirect to another host.
- The rate-limit guidance now matches Kaseya's published policy: 500 requests per hour per endpoint.
- `KASEYA_BMS_MCP_READ_ONLY`, `KASEYA_BMS_NO_LOCAL_DATA`, `KASEYA_BMS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`, `KASEYA_BMS_USER_AGENT` and `PRINTING_PRESS_CLIENT_PROFILE` are declared on every install channel.

### Fixed
- `sync` fills the local store again: list responses wrapped in the BMS envelope are unwrapped, lookup tables stay in the default sync, and the local partition names stay the ones earlier versions used (tickets under `servicedesk`, opportunities under `crm`), so an existing store keeps working.
- `sync` no longer filters on a creation or open date, so a ticket closed after the last sync is no longer kept as open; each sync reads the whole resource.
- `workload` and `contract-burn` key technicians and contracts by id, so two records with the same name are no longer merged.
- Ticket status words are read as whole words: "Unresolved" is not read as resolved, and "Cancelled - No Charge" is read as closed.
- A `--dry-run` sends nothing to Kaseya BMS, and a `--dry-run` with `--output` leaves the named file untouched.
- `doctor` checks the BMS API root rather than reporting a placeholder address.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-10-23

### Security
- **An error can no longer show a credential the server repeated back in an encoded form.** The CLI and the MCP server masked a key, token or password only as written or URL-escaped. When an API error echoed it HTML-entity-encoded, JSON-escaped, double URL-encoded, base64 or hex, it reached the terminal, `--json` and `--agent` output, and MCP tool results. Now any such text that still carries a credential this program holds, in any of those forms, is replaced whole by `[text withheld: it repeated a secret value this program holds]`; the HTTP status, the hint and the exit code are kept. The same check also runs on every error a command prints, including `--json` and `--agent` error output, and on every MCP error result; successful output is unchanged.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-10-22

### Security
- The MCP server no longer forwards a flag whose value names a file or directory on the machine that runs it (for example --db, --input, --output, --config, --home), and refuses any argument the tool schema does not list; both are dropped from the MCP tool schemas and refused by name, so a tool call can neither read or write a local path nor reach another command's file flag. The command line keeps every flag.
- The MCP server no longer opens a local file named by a binary multipart (upload) field and sends it to the vendor; run such an upload with the CLI.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-10-21

### Security
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.10, which distrusts compromised intermediate certificates in `crypto/x509` (GO-2026-6809).** Go now rejects those certificates itself when it verifies the vendor's HTTPS certificate, so the connector no longer depends on the system trust store having been updated to reject them. No other dependency changed.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-10-15

### Changed
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.9 (was 1.26.6).** Go 1.26.9 includes upstream Go security
  fixes, among them the `net/http` advisories GO-2026-6617, GO-2026-6613 and
  GO-2026-6612. The connector's own code is unchanged.
- **The Claude Desktop bundle now carries the companion CLI.** Every MCP tool runs the
  CLI under the hood, but this connector's previous `.mcpb` contained only the MCP
  server, so a one-click install on a machine without the CLI failed at the first tool
  call. This release's bundle ships both binaries side by side for macOS (universal),
  Windows x64 and Linux x64.
- **The MCP server reports its real version.** `serverInfo.version` read `0.0.0-dev` in
  the previous release because the release build stamped the version into the CLI
  only. The release now stamps both and checks the built server's `initialize` reply
  against the tag before publishing.
- **Installers verify what they download.** `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now require a
  sealed (immutable) release, verify both binaries against the release's SHA-256
  sidecars before touching anything, and replace the old binaries in a single
  transaction that is undone if any step fails. (Served from the repository, so this
  already applies to every install, not only this version.)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **A tool-call value could smuggle a refused flag past the MCP server.** The MCP server
  handed each tool argument to the CLI as two separate words, the flag and then its value.
  On a yes/no flag the CLI does not read the next word as a value, so a value that itself
  began with `--` was read as a brand-new flag, including flags the server deliberately
  refuses such as `--deliver`, which can send command output to a URL. Every argument that
  carries a value now travels glued to its flag as one word (`--flag=value`), so the CLI only
  ever reads it as the value of that one named flag, or rejects it, and it can never become a
  second flag. A plain yes/no flag is still a bare `--flag`, and an empty value is still left out.
  Reported privately through SECURITY.md; the same fix is in the pending DataGate connector.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **An agent could point this connector's local database at any file on the machine.**
  The MCP server forwarded a `db` argument straight through to `sync`, and the store runs a
  migration that drops and rebuilds its tables. A tool call naming another application's SQLite
  file would therefore rewrite that file. The MCP surface now refuses arguments that name a
  filesystem location - by name, and by what the flag's own help text says it does, so a newly
  generated path flag is refused before anyone has to notice it. Nothing an agent could
  legitimately call changed.

### Changed
- Every source file now carries one project copyright line (`Copyright 2026 Servosity Inc. and msp-skills contributors`) instead of the ten different strings the fleet had accumulated; individual contributor credit moved to the repository `NOTICE`. Source headers only, no behaviour changed.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **`doctor` reported health it had not established.** It treated any HTTP response to `GET /` as
  a healthy API, so a base URL aimed at the vendor's web UI - where every API path 404s - rendered
  exactly like a working install.
  The credential was never checked at all: the report said `present, not verified` and left you to
  guess. `doctor` now issues one authenticated GET against a real read endpoint and reports what came
  back, so an expired token reads as rejected and a wrong base URL reads as a wrong base URL.
  `--fail-on` no longer scans hints and file paths for the word "error", which is what made it trip on
  healthy connectors.

- **The install prompted for the wrong credentials.** The binary reads environment variables that the
  Claude Desktop bundle never declared, so you were asked for the wrong set and the connector could not
  authenticate. Now declared on every install channel: `KASEYA_BMS_BASE_URL`, `KASEYA_BMS_PASSWORD`, `KASEYA_BMS_TENANT`, `KASEYA_BMS_USERNAME`.

### Changed
- Regenerated on the printing-press 4.24.0 engine: more reliable fleet sync, corrected pagination across large result sets, robust numeric-ID handling, and dependency security updates. Same commands and workflows, sturdier local mirror.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial msp-skills release: `kaseya-bms-cli` + `kaseya-bms-mcp` covering the full
  Kaseya BMS PSA surface (472 commands across service desk, CRM, contracts, finance,
  projects, inventory, and integrations).
- Offline SQLite mirror with full-text `search` and incremental `sync`.
- Six cross-object analytics not in the BMS console: `queue-health`, `stale-tickets`,
  `workload`, `contract-burn`, `unbilled`, and `pipeline`.
- Token-mint auth via `auth login` (username/password/tenant -> JWT), or a pre-minted
  `KASEYA_BMS_TOKEN`; agent-friendly `--agent` JSON mode and `--dry-run` write previews.
