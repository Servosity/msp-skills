## [0.1.11] - unreleased

### Fixed
- **`sync` costs milliseconds of CPU per row, not about a second.** The credential check on rows written to the local store read every row through each decoder it knows, which pinned a CPU for hours on a large first sync. It now refuses a row only when the row carries a secret a vendor response returned (raw or JSON-escaped) and stores every other row unread: a 1,177-record first sync went from 354 CPU-s to under 1. The local store is no longer searched for this program's own credentials; what the CLI prints, writes to other files or sends is checked exactly as before (#612).
- **A withheld row no longer fails `sync`.** `sync` names the withheld row IDs on stderr and in its summary (`"withheld"`), still exits 0 when every other row stored, and keeps that resource's checkpoint, so the next run fetches the row again (#612).
- **`sync` progress shows a real request rate.** On an API that sends no rate-limit headers, `rate_rps` in sync progress climbed without bound (6.6e24 was seen), because the request pacer kept raising a rate no request reached; after that a rate-limit answer could no longer slow requests down. The pacer now raises its rate only while it is holding requests back.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-11-09

### Changed
- **Lower startup cost.** The credential check over the program's own fixed text and the local store's fixed SQL statements reads its verdict from a table built for this connector, instead of decoding that text again in every process (about 0.5 CPU-s at startup and 0.4 CPU-s on each store open). A credential in that text is withheld exactly as before (#662).

### Fixed
- **`sync` memory no longer climbs.** The credential check on every row a sync stores no longer grows with each page or spikes on one large record: between records memory falls back to where it started, so a first sync of a large account finishes in a 1 GB container. The check is exactly as strict as before (#612).
- **One withheld row no longer stops a sync.** A row the credential check keeps out of the local store is skipped instead of failing its whole batch: every other row is stored, `sync` names the withheld row IDs and exits non-zero, and that resource's checkpoint stays put, so the next run fetches the row again (#612).
- **`sync --concurrency` above 1 no longer interleaves writes.** Its parallel workers shared one event writer that nothing serialized, so `--deliver`, `--receipt-file` and `--audit-dir` could crash or record a receipt hash that did not match the output. Writes are now serialized (#676).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-11-06

Rebuilt on CLI Printing Press 4.34.2 (the press upgrade that carries the fix for [GHSA-jh26-vhqh-692c](https://github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/security/advisories/GHSA-jh26-vhqh-692c)).

### Security
- **HTTP mode needs a token.** `nerdio-mcp --transport http` refuses to start until `NERDIO_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` is set, every request must send it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, the server serves `http://127.0.0.1:7777/mcp` by default, and any other address also needs `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key`. The interim advice not to use HTTP mode is removed from the docs.
- **The MCP server is split into a read tool and an execute tool.** A state-changing call through `nerdio_execute` sends nothing until the call also passes `confirm: true`. `NERDIO_MCP_READ_ONLY=1` exposes only read-only tools, and `NERDIO_NO_LOCAL_DATA=1` keeps no local copy of API responses.
- **One shared credential guard.** The CLI and the MCP server now use the fleet's shared credential kit. Any output that carries a credential this program holds (your client secret, a minted token, a credential in your config or profiles) is replaced whole by a fixed notice, on the terminal, in files, in the local store and in MCP results. The client secret and tokens are sent only over https, only to your Nerdio Manager URL or to Microsoft Entra sign-in, and never across a redirect to another server.
- **No placeholder fallbacks.** A missing or placeholder `NERDIO_TOKEN_URL`, `NERDIO_OAUTH_SCOPE` or `NERDIO_BASE_URL` now sends nothing and names the variable to set, instead of posting your client secret to a placeholder tenant or sending the token to a placeholder host.
- **Customer secrets are shown, never stored.** LAPS passwords, BitLocker keys and secure-variable values are shown on your own output when you ask for them, and are kept out of error output, files and the local store. Secure variables are no longer synced.
- **`fleet autoscale-audit --baseline` is refused from the MCP server**, since it reads a local file.

### Changed
- A token URL on a host other than your Nerdio Manager URL or Microsoft Entra sign-in is refused.
- Token fields in API answers print as `[withheld]`.

### Fixed
- The MCP server's startup refusals and `-h` usage text now print before it exits.
- A refused request is no longer retried; `job wait` stops on a final error.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-10-23

### Security
- **An error can no longer show a credential the server repeated back in an encoded form.** The CLI and the MCP server masked a key, token or password only as written or URL-escaped. When an API error or an OAuth token endpoint error echoed it HTML-entity-encoded, JSON-escaped, double URL-encoded, base64 or hex, it reached the terminal, `--json` and `--agent` output, and MCP tool results. Now any such text that still carries a credential this program holds, in any of those forms, is replaced whole by `[text withheld: it repeated a secret value this program holds]`; the HTTP status, the hint and the exit code are kept. The same check also runs on every error a command prints, including `--json` and `--agent` error output, and on every MCP error result; successful output is unchanged.
- **The token request no longer follows a redirect to another server.** `auth login` and the automatic sign-in sent the token request, with your client secret, on to whatever host a redirect from the token URL named. A redirect off the token server now fails instead.

### Fixed
- **`--dry-run` sends nothing, not even a token request.** With no saved token, a dry run used to request one first, sending your client ID and secret to the token URL and saving the token, although a dry run promises that no request is sent. `auth login --dry-run` now also only shows the request it would make, and `auth set-token --dry-run` and `auth logout --dry-run` no longer save or clear your stored credentials.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-10-22

### Security
- The MCP server no longer forwards a flag whose value names a file or directory on the machine that runs it (for example --db, --input, --output, --config, --home), and refuses any argument the tool schema does not list; both are dropped from the MCP tool schemas and refused by name, so a tool call can neither read or write a local path nor reach another command's file flag. The command line keeps every flag.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-10-21

### Security
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.10, which distrusts compromised intermediate certificates in `crypto/x509` (GO-2026-6809).** Go now rejects those certificates itself when it verifies the vendor's HTTPS certificate, so the connector no longer depends on the system trust store having been updated to reject them. No other dependency changed.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-10-15

### Changed
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.9 (was 1.26.6).** Go 1.26.9 includes upstream Go security
  fixes, among them the `net/http` advisories GO-2026-6617, GO-2026-6613 and
  GO-2026-6612. The connector's own code is unchanged.
- **The Claude Desktop bundle now carries the companion CLI.** Every MCP tool runs the
  CLI under the hood, but this connector's previous `.mcpb` contained only the MCP
  server, so a one-click install on a machine without the CLI failed at the first tool
  call. This release's bundle ships both binaries side by side for macOS (universal),
  Windows x64 and Linux x64.
- **The MCP server reports its real version.** `serverInfo.version` read `0.0.0-dev` in
  the previous release because the release build stamped the version into the CLI
  only. The release now stamps both and checks the built server's `initialize` reply
  against the tag before publishing.
- **Installers verify what they download.** `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now require a
  sealed (immutable) release, verify both binaries against the release's SHA-256
  sidecars before touching anything, and replace the old binaries in a single
  transaction that is undone if any step fails. (Served from the repository, so this
  already applies to every install, not only this version.)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **A tool-call value could smuggle a refused flag past the MCP server.** The MCP server
  handed each tool argument to the CLI as two separate words, the flag and then its value.
  On a yes/no flag the CLI does not read the next word as a value, so a value that itself
  began with `--` was read as a brand-new flag, including flags the server deliberately
  refuses such as `--deliver`, which can send command output to a URL. Every argument that
  carries a value now travels glued to its flag as one word (`--flag=value`), so the CLI only
  ever reads it as the value of that one named flag, or rejects it, and it can never become a
  second flag. A plain yes/no flag is still a bare `--flag`, and an empty value is still left out.
  Reported privately through SECURITY.md; the same fix is in the pending DataGate connector.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-01

### Added
- **`NERDIO_NO_CONFIG_WRITE=1` keeps every credential off disk.** Set it and the CLI mints a token per
  invocation instead of caching one in `config.toml`. The MCP server honours the same switch,
  which it previously could not: it resolved its own config path and ignored `--config`
  entirely, so a Claude Desktop setup kept a plaintext token cache even when the CLI had been
  told not to write one. `auth logout` still clears a config that already exists - the switch
  suppresses credential writes, not the erase.

### Changed
- Install and remote-agent documentation corrected against the shipped binaries. The remote
  section named `mcp-remote`, which bridges the opposite direction and cannot publish a local
  stdio server at all; connectors that parse `--transport http` now point at the native flag
  and the rest at `supergateway`. The HTTP endpoint is `/mcp`, not the bare root the docs gave.
  The Windows install path and a fallback paragraph describing an `npx` install that is not
  offered were both wrong and are gone. A new `check_install_docs` gate holds these claims
  against the binaries and installers so they cannot drift again.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **An agent could point this connector's local database at any file on the machine.**
  The MCP server forwarded a `db` argument straight through to `sync`, and the store runs a
  migration that drops and rebuilds its tables. A tool call naming another application's SQLite
  file would therefore rewrite that file. The MCP surface now refuses arguments that name a
  filesystem location - by name, and by what the flag's own help text says it does, so a newly
  generated path flag is refused before anyone has to notice it. Nothing an agent could
  legitimately call changed.

### Changed
- Every source file now carries one project copyright line (`Copyright 2026 Servosity Inc. and msp-skills contributors`) instead of the ten different strings the fleet had accumulated; individual contributor credit moved to the repository `NOTICE`. Source headers only, no behaviour changed.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **`doctor` reported health it had not established.** It treated any HTTP response to `GET /` as
  a healthy API, so a base URL aimed at the vendor's web UI - where every API path 404s - rendered
  exactly like a working install.
  The credential was never checked at all: the report said `present, not verified` and left you to
  guess. `doctor` now issues one authenticated GET against a real read endpoint and reports what came
  back, so an expired token reads as rejected and a wrong base URL reads as a wrong base URL.
  It also dialled the shipped placeholder base URL (`https://nmm.example.com`) and rendered the resulting failure
  as `FAIL API: unreachable`, telling an operator who had supplied every credential the install asked
  for that they were broken. It now refuses to dial a placeholder and names `NERDIO_BASE_URL`,
  the variable that actually fixes it.
  `--fail-on` no longer scans hints and file paths for the word "error", which is what made it trip on
  healthy connectors.

### Fixed
- OAuth client credentials supplied through the environment (`NERDIO_CLIENT_ID` and
  `NERDIO_CLIENT_SECRET`) are no longer written to
  `~/.config/nerdio-cli/config.toml`. `Load()` marks env-supplied values so
  `configForSave()` can keep them off disk, but `SaveTokens()` cleared those
  markers before saving, so every token mint - including the automatic one on an ordinary
  authenticated command, with no `auth login` step involved - rewrote the live client ID and secret into
  the config file in cleartext. That defeats the setups this is meant to
  support, where the secret lives only in the OS credential store (Keychain,
  Windows Credential Manager) and reaches the process as an environment
  variable at launch. The minted access token is still cached there, and an
  explicit `auth login --client-id <id> --client-secret <secret>` still stores
  what you passed it. **Deliberate behaviour change:** credentials that came
  from the environment are no longer persisted by `auth login` either, so a
  shell that later drops those variables must set them again or pass the flags.
  Thanks to @Xenith-B for the report (#266).

### Changed
- Regenerated on the printing-press 4.24.0 engine: more reliable fleet sync, corrected pagination across large result sets, robust numeric-ID handling, and dependency security updates. Same commands and workflows, sturdier local mirror.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial msp-skills release: the `nerdio-cli` CLI and `nerdio-mcp` MCP server for
  the Nerdio Manager for MSP (NMM) Partner REST API.
- Cross-account fleet commands: `fleet autoscale-audit` (pools with autoscale off
  or drifting), `fleet host-estate` (every session host and its power state), and
  `fleet billing-rollup` (per-customer billed/unpaid/usage rollup).
- `usages drift` for month-over-month consumption comparison across accounts.
- `job wait` - poll any async NMM job to a terminal state with a typed exit code,
  plus `scripted-actions fan-run` to execute one action across many accounts and
  wait for all of them.
- Coverage for host pools, session hosts, desktop images, Intune devices, backup
  and recovery vaults, reservations, networks, scripted actions, and secure
  variables.
- Offline SQLite mirror (`sync`) with full-text `search`, OAuth2 client-credentials
  auth against each MSP's own NMM instance, and `--agent` JSON output mode.
