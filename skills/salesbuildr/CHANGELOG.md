## [0.1.2] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **An agent could point this connector's local database at any file on the machine.**
  The MCP server forwarded a `db` argument straight through to `sync`, and the store runs a
  migration that drops and rebuilds its tables. A tool call naming another application's SQLite
  file would therefore rewrite that file. The MCP surface now refuses arguments that name a
  filesystem location - by name, and by what the flag's own help text says it does, so a newly
  generated path flag is refused before anyone has to notice it. Nothing an agent could
  legitimately call changed.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **`doctor` reported health it had not established.** It treated any HTTP response to `GET /` as
  a healthy API, so a base URL aimed at the vendor's web UI - where every API path 404s - rendered
  exactly like a working install.
  The credential was never checked at all: the report said `present, not verified` and left you to
  guess. `doctor` now issues one authenticated GET against a real read endpoint and reports what came
  back, so an expired token reads as rejected and a wrong base URL reads as a wrong base URL.
  It also dialled the shipped placeholder base URL (`https://{tenant}.salesbuildr.com/public-api`) and rendered the resulting failure
  as `FAIL API: unreachable`, telling an operator who had supplied every credential the install asked
  for that they were broken. It now refuses to dial a placeholder and names `SALESBUILDR_BASE_URL`,
  the variable that actually fixes it.
  `--fail-on` no longer scans hints and file paths for the word "error", which is what made it trip on
  healthy connectors.

- **The install prompted for the wrong credentials.** The binary reads environment variables that the
  Claude Desktop bundle never declared, so you were asked for the wrong set and the connector could not
  authenticate. Now declared on every install channel: `SALESBUILDR_BASE_URL`.

### Changed
- Regenerated on the printing-press 4.24.0 engine: more reliable fleet sync, corrected pagination across large result sets, robust numeric-ID handling, and dependency security updates. Same commands and workflows, sturdier local mirror.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial msp-skills release: `salesbuildr-cli` + `salesbuildr-mcp` covering the
  full Salesbuildr Public API - companies, contacts, products, opportunities,
  quotes, pricing books, and templates.
- Offline SQLite mirror with full-text `search`, `sql`, `export`, and `sync`.
- Cross-object analytics with no portal equivalent: `quote stale`, `quote thin`,
  `quote funnel`, `pricing drift`, `opportunity velocity`/`winrate`/`mrr-forecast`,
  `product velocity`, `company whitespace`, and `reconcile-psa`.
- Agent-native output (`--agent`, `--json`, `--dry-run`) and MCP server for any
  MCP-capable agent.
