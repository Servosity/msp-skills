[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.11] - 2026-10-22

### Security
- The MCP server no longer forwards a flag whose value names a file or directory on the machine that runs it (for example --db, --input, --output, --config, --home), and refuses any argument the tool schema does not list; both are dropped from the MCP tool schemas and refused by name, so a tool call can neither read or write a local path nor reach another command's file flag. The command line keeps every flag.
- `raw query` and `raw mutation` accept GraphQL variables over MCP only as an inline JSON object, not an @path file.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-10-21

### Security
- **Rebuilt with Go 1.26.10, which distrusts compromised intermediate certificates in `crypto/x509` (GO-2026-6809).** Go now rejects those certificates itself when it verifies the vendor's HTTPS certificate, so the connector no longer depends on the system trust store having been updated to reject them. No other dependency changed.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-10-13

### Changed
- Built with Go 1.26.9 (was 1.26.6). This fixes three Go `net/http` security advisories that `govulncheck` found reachable in the previous build: GO-2026-6617 (an HTTP/2 crash), GO-2026-6613 and GO-2026-6612. No commands, flags or output changed.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-09-28

### Changed
- **The Claude Desktop bundle now carries the companion CLI.** Every MCP tool runs the
  CLI under the hood, but the `.mcpb` used to contain only the MCP server, so a one-click
  install on a machine without the CLI failed at the first tool call. The bundle now ships
  both binaries side by side for macOS (universal), Windows x64 and Linux x64. Older
  bundles are unchanged; this release's bundle is the first for this connector to include it.
- **The MCP server reports its real version.** `serverInfo.version` used to read
  `0.0.0-dev` (or a hard-coded literal) in every released MCP binary because the release
  build stamped the version into the CLI only. The release now stamps both and checks the
  built server's `initialize` reply against the tag before publishing.
- **Installers verify what they download.** `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now require a
  sealed (immutable) release, verify both binaries against the release's SHA-256 sidecars
  before touching anything, and replace the old binaries in a single transaction that is
  undone if any step fails. (Served from the repository, so this applies to every install
  from now on, not only this version.)
- No connector code changed in this release; it exists so the published bundle and
  binaries pick up the release-pipeline fixes above.

## [0.1.7] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed
- **A tool-call value could smuggle a refused flag past the MCP server.** The MCP server
  handed each tool argument to the CLI as two separate words, the flag and then its value.
  On a yes/no flag the CLI does not read the next word as a value, so a value that itself
  began with `--` was read as a brand-new flag, including flags the server deliberately
  refuses such as `--deliver`, which can send command output to a URL. Every argument that
  carries a value now travels glued to its flag as one word (`--flag=value`), so the CLI only
  ever reads it as the value of that one named flag, or rejects it, and it can never become a
  second flag. A plain yes/no flag is still a bare `--flag`, and an empty value is still left out.
  Reported privately through SECURITY.md; the same fix is in the pending DataGate connector.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **An agent could point this connector's local database at any file on the machine.**
  The MCP server forwarded a `db` argument straight through to `sync`, and the store runs a
  migration that drops and rebuilds its tables. A tool call naming another application's SQLite
  file would therefore rewrite that file. The MCP surface now refuses arguments that name a
  filesystem location - by name, and by what the flag's own help text says it does, so a newly
  generated path flag is refused before anyone has to notice it. Nothing an agent could
  legitimately call changed.

### Changed
- Every source file now carries one project copyright line (`Copyright 2026 Servosity Inc. and msp-skills contributors`) instead of the ten different strings the fleet had accumulated; individual contributor credit moved to the repository `NOTICE`. Source headers only, no behaviour changed.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed
- **`doctor` reported health it had not established.** It treated any HTTP response to `GET /` as
  a healthy API, so a base URL aimed at the vendor's web UI - where every API path 404s - rendered
  exactly like a working install.
  The credential was never checked at all: the report said `present, not verified` and left you to
  guess. `doctor` now issues one authenticated GET against a real read endpoint and reports what came
  back, so an expired token reads as rejected and a wrong base URL reads as a wrong base URL.
  `--fail-on` no longer scans hints and file paths for the word "error", which is what made it trip on
  healthy connectors.

- **The install prompted for the wrong credentials.** The binary reads environment variables that the
  Claude Desktop bundle never declared, so you were asked for the wrong set and the connector could not
  authenticate. Now declared on every install channel: `SUPEROPS_BASE_URL`, `SUPEROPS_REGION`, `SUPEROPS_SUBDOMAIN`.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-08-17

### Security

- Go toolchain bumped to **go1.26.6**, which fixes **GO-2026-6218** (quadratic
  complexity in `net/url`, reachable from `cliutil.ProbeReachable`). The
  previously released binary was built with go1.26.5 and carried the advisory.
  CI could not catch this: the workflows request `go-version: "1.26"`, which
  resolves to the latest patched Go, so the security gate scanned a patched
  toolchain while the build honoured the pinned one. See issue #210.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- fix(superops): restore CustomerSubDomain header + EU region routing (#132) (#134)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-06-16

### Changed

- docs(superops): consolidate 0.1.1 fix into the 0.1.2 release section (#114)
- fix(superops): request scalar GraphQL fields without sub-selections (#114) (#126)
- fleet: re-vendor 48 connectors to printing-press 4.24.0 engine (#96)
- chore(fleet): press-version provenance + back-fill hand-fix ledgers (#91)
- fix: drop false "with sound" demo claim, highlight first-party Servosity, point backup/DR skills at Servosity (#77)
- fix(install): honor GITHUB_TOKEN/GH_TOKEN in fetch_stdout across all skills (#31)

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial msp-skills release: `superops-cli` + `superops-mcp` covering the SuperOps
  PSA+RMM GraphQL surface - tickets, assets, alerts, clients, sites, users, contracts,
  invoices, worklogs, technicians, service items, IT docs, and KB - as typed
  `list`/`get` subcommands and MCP tools.
- Cross-entity views the console can't compose in one screen: `sla-watch` (open tickets
  breaching or near their resolution SLA, grouped by tech or client), `client-360` (one
  client's sites, users, contracts, open tickets, assets, and open invoices), `unbilled`
  (billable logged worklog totaled per client - the month-end reconciliation target),
  `at-risk-assets` (endpoints both unpatched and actively alerting), `alert-coverage`
  (alerts split resolved vs unresolved per client), `stale-tickets` (open tickets idle
  past N days), and `context-ticket` (one ticket + worklogs + client + SLA as an
  agent-shaped, `--select`-friendly bundle).
- Offline SQLite sync (`sync`, incremental and resumable; access-denied resources are
  warnings, not failures) with FTS5 full-text `search` and `analytics` over synced data.
- Read-only by design: every typed command reads; the single write path is `raw mutation`
  (with `raw query` for reads), and `--dry-run` previews the exact GraphQL request.
- Agent ergonomics: `--agent` mode (JSON, non-interactive), `--select`/`--compact` field
  control, `--deliver` output sinks, named `profile` flag sets, `which` capability lookup,
  and `doctor` for an auth/connectivity health check.
