# Maintainer tooling

These scripts are for **maintainers of this repository**, not for MSP users. They generate
the catalog, compute the release build matrix, and run the CI gates (skill contract, markdown
links, release contract, DCO sign-off, repo hygiene). If you just want to install a skill or
the statusline, you do not need anything in this folder - see the root
[README.md](../../README.md) and [`tools/statusline/`](../statusline/).

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `verify_all.sh` | One command, one verdict: runs every gate below. `bash tools/maintainer/verify_all.sh` |
| `build-catalog.py` | Regenerates `catalog.json` and the README catalog table from each skill's `manifest.json`. |
| `release_matrix.py` | Prints the GitHub Actions build matrix (skills x os/arch). |
| `check_skill_contract.py` | Asserts every skill has the required frontmatter and files. |
| `check_release_contract.py` | Asserts install scripts and release assets agree on names. |
| `check_md_links.py` | Verifies relative Markdown links resolve. |
| `check_dco.sh` | Verifies every commit carries a DCO `Signed-off-by` line. |
| `check_mcp_gate.py` | Boots a skill's MCP server over stdio and asserts no registered tool is default-denied by the tenant gate. Needs no credentials. |
| `ci_guards.sh` | Repo hygiene: no em-dashes, no personal paths, no obvious secrets. |
| `gen_governance.py` | Drafts a skill's `governance.md` from its CLI surface. |
| `registry.py` | Shared loader for `skills.json` (the single source of truth for skills). |
| `skills.json` | Per-skill metadata: owner/repo, binary names, vendor, status. |
